# OTP_Encryption
Using one time pad encryption, and two daemons this project allows two clients to exchange messages and have them encrypted/decrypted using a key generated by the user. It allows for any size message as long as the key provided is long enough.

To run the program you must first be in a unix environment, since the code uses Unix libraries

1. Alter permissions of the bash script that will compile the program (chmod +x makeall)
2. run the bash script to compile the programs
3. Generate a key using key gen. It takes one parameter which is the size of the key you would like to make (./keygen [SIZE OF KEY]). You need to pipe the contents into a file with a name of your choice (ex. ./keygen 64 > key)
4. Boot the two daemons on a specified port, and run them in the background. (ex. ./otp_enc_d [PORT NUM] &)
5. use the clients to exchange messages via text files and have them encrypted/decrypted. (./otp_enc [message file] [key file] [portnum of daemon])
